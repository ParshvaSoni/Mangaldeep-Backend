    2)https://dev.to/harshmangalam/mobile-otp-based-authentication-and-authorization-api-using-nodejs-and-mongodb-2hpk
2) we need to add moongose timestamps in each schema



// MEDIUM PRIORITY


// LESS PRIORITY
1) we are creating a temp object before saving the body to avoid unncessary field passed by the user, but that is not required because that is handled by the joi for example if additional is the unnecessary field than joi will give an error of "additionals is not allowed",
2) Gender Enum, Metal Purity Enum etc can be saved to single file in extra folder
